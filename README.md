# PPM Image Library (v1.0)
This is the first version of the PPM Imgage library that I'm writing. This project is born only like a base for a future and small - but interesting - project.

The library is fully documented, and in a future version I will be use Doxygen for generating the documentation. 

The following are few example (image converted because of their size):

*First test output, with set pixel*

*Second test output, with set array of pixels*
